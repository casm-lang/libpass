#   the copyright holders of libpass give you permission to link libpass
#   with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the

#   the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you
#   also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions
#   of the license of that module. An independent module is a module which
#   is not derived from or based on libpass. If you modify libpass, you
#   may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are
#   not obliged to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
